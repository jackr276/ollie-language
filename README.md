## Current Goal
Current goal involves getting a very basic subset of the language to produce workable assembly code

### Global TODO(tentative)
- Preprocessor implementation, testing and validation
- Dependency graph build-up
- Dependency graph implementation and compiler-order determination in compiler.c
- (maybe) ternary operation support
- SSA implementation
- Backend build-up
