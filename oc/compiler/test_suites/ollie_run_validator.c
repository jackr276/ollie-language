 *  The Ollie Run Validator has been designed to, in conjuction with the memory checker,
 *  give us automated capabilities when validating tests that are able to be validated
 *  via run. What does it mean to be validated via run? - if we compile and run the program,
 *  the *shell exit code* should match what we are expecting. Remember that the shell
 *  exit code is what main returns. Some tests have been designed to do this to validate
 *  full end-to-end runs
 *
 *
 *  Strategy is as follows: we first in the main thread read in every single test file in the
 *  given directory into a big array of all test files. Following that, the array is divided up
 *  so that every single thread is given it's own subset of test files to work with(index start(inclusive)
 *  to end(exclusive)). This should avoid the need for us to do any locks. Then each thread 
 *  is told to start. Internal to the thread, for each file, we will tokenize the file to see if
 *  we have a special tag TODO WHAT IS THE TAG. If so, we will compile the file using oc, run it
 *  inside of a subshell, and compare the result with the expected result. If they match we've succeeded,
 *  if they don't then we have a failure and we put it inside of the error file list
