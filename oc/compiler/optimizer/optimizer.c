/**
 * The compound logic optimizer will go through and look for compound and or or statements
 * that are parts of branch endings and see if they're able to be short-circuited. These
 * statements have been pre-marked by the cfg constructor, so whichever survive until here are going to 
 * be optimized
 *
 * KEY ASSUMPTION: The basic block that contains a branch will contain all of the necessary
 * information for this to happen. This means that the actual branch must contain straight
 * line code
 *
 *
 * Here is a brief example:
 * t9 <- 0x2
 * t10 <- x_0 < t9
 * t11 <- 0x1
 * t12 <- x_0 != t11
 * t13 <- t10 && t12 <-------- COMPOUND JUMP
 * cbranch_nz .L8 else .L9
 *
 * .L8():
 * t14 <- 0x2
 * t15 <- x_0 * t14
 * x_2 <- t15
 * jmp .L5
 *
 * .L9():
 * t16 <- 0x3
 * t17 <- x_0 + t16
 * x_1 <- t17
 * jmp .L5	
 *
 * We could optimize this statement by realizing that if the first condition fails(t10), there is no chance
 * for the next one to succeed, and as such we can jump immediately after t10 is defined
 *
 * TURNS INTO THIS:
 *  
 *  .L1
 * t9 <- 0x2
 * t10 <- x_0 < t9
 * cbranch_ge .L8 else .L3 ---------------- If it's more than it can't work, so we leave
 *
 * .L33
 * t11 <- 0x1
 * t12 <- x_0 != t11
 * cbranch_ne .L8 else .L9
 * --------------------------------t13 <- t10 && t12 <-------------------- No longer a need for this one
 * -------------------------------- No longer a need for the original branch at all --------------------
 *
 * .L8():
 * t14 <- 0x2
 * t15 <- x_0 * t14
 * x_2 <- t15
 * jmp .L5
 *
 * .L9():
 * t16 <- 0x3
 * t17 <- x_0 + t16
 * x_1 <- t17
 * jmp .L5
