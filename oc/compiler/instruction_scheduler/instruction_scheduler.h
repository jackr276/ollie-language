 * This header defines the APIs for the instruction scheduler submodule
 *
 * NOTES:
 * The ollie compiler exclusively targets x86-64 processors. Since the modern variants of these processors are dynamically
 * scheduled, the instruction scheduler does not need to insert NOP operations
 *
 * NOTE: Since this is not an absolutely essential piece of the compiler, it has been omitted for this first cut
